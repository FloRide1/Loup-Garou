# Loup-Garou
### By Florian FloRide Reimat

## About 
This is a frontend website (HTML + CSS) and JS (JQuery :( ) + backend
using NodeJs and socket.io for a game:
The Werewolves of Millers Hollow (Loup Garou de Thircelieux in French) 
and also an old Sandbox project for me.

## Actually
It's usefull for you if you don't have the game and want to use the card
because it's just an card selector now.

## How to Install it
Download this repo and launch it with npm

## Todo 
- [ ] Remake from scratch
```sh
git clone https://github.com/FloRide1/Loup-Garou.git
cd Loup-Garou && npm install 
node app.js
```
